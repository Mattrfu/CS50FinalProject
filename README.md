# CS50FinalProject
Attendance Tracker for a friend's high school robotics team.

# Why we built it
While various attendance trackers exist already, we wanted to create something that did not require a lot of work for the user to get started. More or less, we wanted attendance to be completed quickly and reliabely, so people could gauge how much time they spent work on the robotics project.

# What we used
Built on Python and flask, this project uses SQL, HTML, and CSS to create both the website and the database that stores attendance information.
